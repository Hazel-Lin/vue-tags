# Vue-Tags

Vue-tags is a simple tagging component ready to drop in your projects. It is highly customizable and easy to use.

## Features
- Reorder tags using drag and drop
- Edit and delete tag support
- Optional clear all button

## Why
I needed a simple tagging component for a project I was working on. I couldn't find one that was simple and easy to use so I decided to create my own. And I can learn how to create a Vue component in the process.
